  We all get stuck in our ways coding things in a certain way - a recent project's tooling has been making me look as alternatives.

I have been wiorking on a project with some fairly strict (to me) lint settings which led me to discovering the inset property.

## You CAN teach an old dog new tricks!

To be fair I am always up for learning new things which is why I still love building web sites - every day is a school day. One thing we create on nearly any project is a card component, and most of the time they have a single clickable link that covers the whole card area.

### TRBL spells trouble

As with borders or padding etc I am very used to chunking out the same code everytime top, right, bottom and left settings to spread the link across the card - but lint said NO! I was forced to investigate the shorthand and must say was surprised it had passed me by for so long. 

### Can I use it?  

Inset was added to css in 2020 as part of the **CSS Logical Properties and Values Level 1 specification** and it widely supported (niche browsers aside).

### An example card

My biggest use of the CSS inset property is to make a link cover an entire card component. You want the entire card to be clickable, not just specific elements within it.

Imagine you have a card component with some content, and you want a link inside the card to cover the entire card, making the whole area clickable.

[Example on Codepen](https://codepen.io/maxray/pen/rNXxvzy)


### HTML

```html
<div class="card">
    <a href="#" class="card-link"></a>
    <h3>Card Title</h3>
    <p>This is some card content.</p>
</div>

```

### CSS

```css
.card {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    position: relative;
    width: 300px;
    padding: 20px;
    border: 3px solid black;
    background-color: orange;
}

.card-link {
    position: absolute;
    /*  
        We don't need to do all this.
        top: 0;
        right: 0;
        bottom: 0;
        left: 0; 
    */
    inset: 0; /* This sets top, right, bottom, and left to 0 */
    z-index: 1; 
}

```

### What is going on?

* position: relative on the .card: This establishes the card as the positioning context for its child elements.
* position: absolute on the .card-link: This allows the link to be positioned absolutely relative to the .card container.
* inset: 0: This is shorthand for top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0;, which makes the link span the entire width and height of the .card component.
* z-index: 1: Ensures the link is on top of the card's content, making the whole card clickable.

### The inset property simplifies positioning when you want to cover the entire parent container. Instead of writing separate top, right, bottom, and left properties, you can use inset: 0; to achieve the same result with cleaner, more readable code.

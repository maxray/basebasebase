This year our road WhatsApp group suggested doing an advent of window displays.  I am always happy to get on board with this sort of thing but there was little to no chance of me going with a twee design. 

My daughter got involved and we came up with a design to be both our Christmas card this year AND the window.. what do you think?  :)

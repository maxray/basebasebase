  It has been (checks notes) 7 whole years since my last foray into Sourdough. Time to try it again.

A lot of time has passed since I last made sourdough bread.. in fact we are onto our second term of that 'orrible orange guy.. who'd have thunk it! 

### See the bread... make the bread

I had pretty much forgotten about ['baking bread'](/blog/2017-12-31-bring-forth-the-sourdough/)... life gets in the way sometimes and of all the types making a sourdough loaf by hand is a time consuming task. As of late time is something I don't seem to have loads of. A chance encounter with some glorious bread has inspired me though. 

### Spooky spooky skeletons

Running the allotment bar with Harvey for the Halloween party - we ended up sorting out pumpkin soup and bread for people. Harvey pulled out the most perfect loaf I have seen and turns out he has got really into making them - so much so he did a ['course at Loaf'](https://loaf.coop/shop/sourdough/) in Stirchley. 

It got me reminiscing and so here I am starting the process of making a starter once again.. fingers crossed! If I fail I shall be booking a course.  :D

<h1 class="title">Working with me</h1>

As time goes on building websites and marketing & communications becomes more and more specialised. It can feel pretty overwhelming wondering which things you need to pay attention to and which you can ignore. The acronyms, programming languages and design styles.. where do you begin?

Whether it is building up your digital collateral from the ground up, reviewing and improving on what you have got or some general coaching to get you set in the right direction I've got you covered.

<h2 class="title">How I like to work on projects</h2>
<p>When approaching a website design and build I work based on the following process, this
can be tweaked to fit your requirements if you have specific methods or milestones that
need to be achieved.</p>
<ul><li>
<h3>Stage 1 - Kick off</h3>
<p>In this initial phase, we gather essential information about the project and its goals to lay the groundwork for the entire process.</p></li>
<li>
<h3>Stage 2 - Gather</h3>
<p>
We collect information to assess the current status, trends, and competitors. This stage may involve creating audience personas or conducting user interviews to consider users' perspectives.</p></li>
<li>
<h3>Stage 3 - Identify</h3>
<p>
We pinpoint potential pathways into the website and analyze them against data to address any issues users may encounter.</p></li>
<li>
<h3>Stage 4 - Wireframing and Information Architecture</h3>
<p>
Detailed planning for the website build takes place, including wireframing pages and defining functionality requirements. This stage helps visualize the site structure and content, allowing us to refine the user experience.</p></li>
<li>
<h3>Stage 5 - Creative</h3>
<p>
Upon completing the wireframe, we apply design elements to align with the brand's look and feel. This stage ensures a visually appealing and cohesive user experience consistent with the brand.</p></li>
<li>
<h3>Stage 6 - Build</h3>
<p>
Once the design is approved, the website development begins. A technical build document outlines all aspects, and any changes at this point could impact the project's timeline. User acceptance testing is conducted to ensure the site meets its goals and addresses any issues.</p></li>
<li>
<h3>Stage 7 - Site Launch and next steps</h3>
<p>
After resolving any issues identified during testing, the site is launched. A 30-day period allows for addressing any post-launch issues, and ongoing support options are discussed, including development time or additional training if needed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>I've got 99 problems and the web is one!</h3>
<p>If any of the following situations seems familiar and you would like some help then <a href="/contact/">let me know!</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>I need help adding to or changing things on my existing website.</h4>
      <p>You have a site but the original designer is long gone or doesn't reply to your requests. Although my main skills are in Wordpress and Static site generators I can work with most platforms. It all depends how (and when) the site was built.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>I have a Wordpress website but don't really know how to edit anything.</h4>
<p>Wordpress is a great content management system, it is really easy to use and as long as your site template is fairly open I should be able to get you happily editing and creating new content in no time at all!</p></li>
  <li><h4>I haven't got a website, I am starting a new business.. where do I start?</h4>
<p>There is lot's to consider in this situation, but you may well find that starting your business is actually more important right now! I can help you choose a scalable solution, plan out your needs and look at the wider picture in terms of social and email marketing.</p></li>
  <li><h4>I have a website but it doesn't do anything for me.</h4>
<p>Let's start off be reviewing what you have. Are people getting to your site and not doing what you expect, or perhaps they are not even getting to your site. Once we have reviewed your business and the way you use your website we can plan an effective strategy to move forward with .</p></li>

<blockquote ><p>"Sush Kellyâ€™s work was instrumental in the success of our community buyout project. He has built our website, including application forms, and designed strong logos, clear brand identities and attractive professional documentation. And he did all this at speed  and with endless good humour and where necessary grace under fire. 
  <br><br>
  He played a key role in communicating with local people and turning them into investors, and we are enormously grateful. We look forward to continuing to work with Sush in the long term."</p></blockquote>

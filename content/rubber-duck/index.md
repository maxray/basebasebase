	<h1>Rubber Duck Debugging - Let's try and solve your problem! </h1>
	<p>In software engineering, rubber duck debugging, also known as rubberducking, is a technique for fixing code issues. The idea is to explain the problem out loud or in writing, as if talking to a rubber duck or another inanimate object. </p>

<p>Lots of developers have been in a situation where they're stuck on a problem. Sometimes, when they start explaining the issue to someone, even if that person doesn't know anything about programming, they suddenly figure out the solution while talking it through.</p>
<h2  class="title"> I can be your duck (but with some added knowledge)</h2>
<p>Throughout my career working in studios, especially when I was overseeing a team I would find myself being a slightly more helpful rubber duck, chatting through issues and finding solutions.</p>
<h3 class="title">It is a quiet life as a freelancer</h3>
<p> As much as I love freelancing it is a quiet existence and I really do miss those little problem solving challenges, so I thought I would try a thing.</p>
<p>If you have a design/web (or anything else) problem and fancy a 10min Zoom to talk your problem through book a slot using the Calendly link below :) </p>

  I cannot overstate the quality of Sush Kelly's work on our website and other promotional material. Without this there is no way we would have enjoyed the significant successes we have achieved as a group this year. His eye for design, finesse and attention to detail are matched only by his diligence, work ethic and seemingly endless patience when faced with barrages of last minute requests. He is without doubt one of the loveliest, kindest and most accomodating people with whom i've ever had the pleasure of working.

Better Streets for Birmingham campaigns for changes to our travel and planning infrastructure to improve the sustainability, efficiency and safety of our streets. By identifying, supporting and advocating for changes to our environment that enable car-free journeys, we aim to make active travel and public transport the default options for trips around our city.

### What we did:

Initially Better Streets just needed an identity to bring together the growing group of local residents and concerned citizens who felt strongly about the cause.

The logo is based on the idea of a group that comes from all political parties and come round the table to work together to make the streets of Birmingham a better place for us all. It encompasses the red yellow blue and green of the main parties with the interlinking circles acting like chairs round a table.

Versions of the logo for use on social media and the web quickly followed along with a website  and various flyers and leaflets.

Sadly - despite all their efforts the deaths and serious injuries continue and after a really serious hit and run locally there was a huge outpouring of support leading to a mass demonstration and heightened media coverage. We created some placard posters and flyers to bring everyone together to converge and make our voices felt.

As well as regular activations at the local markets and other suitable events Better Streets ran a red light campaign, using citizen science to log red light jumping. In September 2023, 32 Better Streets for Birmingham members from across the city volunteered to watch 21 different junctions for drivers running red lights. They collectively volunteered for 50 sessions, totalling a huge 44 hours and 56 minutes.

A further ‘B Plate’ campaign followed with drivers signing a Better Drivers, better streets pledge with the option to have a special B plate to display their allegiance.

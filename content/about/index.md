<h1 class="title">Freelance designer & developer based in Birmingham.</h1>

I have years of experience within the design industry. I design and build websites that are clean fast and user focused. I work with all sorts of businesses and also supply services to design agencies be it front-end development or consulting.

My approach is very much collaborative and I like to work closely with my clients to make sure I find a solution that not only fits the brief but the budget. I can work remotely or on site depending on the needs of a project.

I'm Sush. I design and build responsive websites, primarily in Wordpress and Jekyll. Need some help on a project? Get in touch
